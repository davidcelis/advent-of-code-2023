# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

These are my solutions for [2023's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). To run any of my solutions, you can just run its `main.rb` file with `ruby`. For example, to run my solution for the first day, just run `ruby day-01/main.rb` in your Terminal. Each day also includes a README that's simply the text of the problem from Advent of Code itself in case it ever becomes unavailable on the web.
